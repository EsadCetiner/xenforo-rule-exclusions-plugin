## Description

This plugin contains rule exclusions for [XenForo](https://xenforo.com/), a PHP-based internet forum software package. These rule exclusions are designed to resolve common false positives and allow for easier integration with the OWASP CRS (CRS).

## Installation

For full and up to date instructions for the different available plugin installation methods, refer to [How to Install a Plugin](https://coreruleset.org/docs/concepts/plugins/#how-to-install-a-plugin) in the official CRS documentation.

## Testing

After the plugin is enabled, XenForo should work without problems caused by CRS (for example, false positives while blocking requests). If problems still occur then please file a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/coreruleset/xenforo-rule-exclusions). (Note that high paranoia level deployments may require additional tuning beyond this plugin.)
